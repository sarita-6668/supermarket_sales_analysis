In this project, I analyzed extensive supermarket sales data using MySQL Workbench to gain valuable insights into revenue generation, customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The analysis focused on key aspects such as top-selling branches, customer segmentation, popular products, payment methods, and regional pricing strategies.

Key Findings:
✅ Total Revenue & Top-Selling Branch: Identified the highest revenue-generating branch, providing insights into regional sales distribution.
✅ Customer Segmentation: Analyzed sales distribution between members and normal customers to optimize marketing and loyalty programs.
✅ Top Grossing Product Line: Determined which product line generates the most income to enhance profitability strategies.
✅ Pricing Strategies: Calculated the average unit price by branch to understand regional price preferences.
✅ Payment Preferences: Found the most popular payment method, helping refine payment processing strategies.
✅ Profitability Analysis: Measured the average gross margin percentage per product line to inform pricing and marketing decisions.
✅ Sales Trends: Identified the busiest sales day, optimizing staffing and inventory management.
✅ Product Demand: Assessed total quantity sold per product line to improve inventory management.
✅ Tax Collection & Gender Analysis: Analyzed the total tax collected by gender to gain insights into spending patterns.

Business Impact:
These insights can help supermarkets optimize marketing campaigns, improve inventory management, enhance pricing strategies, and refine customer engagement efforts, leading to increased revenue and business growth.
